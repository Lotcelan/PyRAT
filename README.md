# PyRAT
RAT Tool to learn about security etc..

Currently in Alpha Omega Beta testing phase (only a simple reverse shell works)

This is just a learning project, you won't hack anyone with that x)

Usage : main.py is the server, client.py is the client. The client connects to the server.
In the "listen IP" on main.py, put your IP, in the client.py change this IP manually.

TODO :

- Fix memory leaks (threads for each payloads)
- Fix output rendering in the interactive shell
- Add many payloads
- Add build functionnality (only the UI is done)
- Make the client interface more friendly
